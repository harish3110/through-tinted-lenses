## Fact: Deep learning is hard!

I have a background in Electronics Engineering and having studied in the sub-continent, the amount of exposure to programming was virtually non-existent. Since graduating, I have slowly transitioned my way into the field of data science and machine learning by starting from scratch and building block after block, the necessary skills to call myself a data scientist, and land a job in the field.

Whenever I meet anyone from a non-ML background and tell them  I'm a data scientist, their response is almost always the same. They nod in appreciation and say something like, "That's the future!" and that "I'm on the right path!". And if they're a parent, holding to the Indian parent tag who takes the first opportunity to 'help mold' their child's future, would introduce me to their son/daughter and ask me to discuss the field with them. Then they begin asking questions about the area like self-driving cars and other popular fields and finally land on to the million-dollar question "Is it difficult to become a deep learning engineer?". To this, I always find myself lying and spout out of phrases like "it's easy" and "anyone can do it"! Whereas the fact of the matter is that it entirely isn't.

Being a self-learner, I learned how to code in Python, understood the fundamental concepts of data science and machine learning by following an array of popular MOOCs such as Coursera, Udacity, etc. as well as completed certifications from reputed colleges in India. It has been an incredible journey of learning, but it has not been easy! There is always a huge learning curve, and even after you complete a course or certification, there's still that void of not having built anything meaningful. Every one of the courses makes a point of conveying the theory and underlying maths well but almost always fail at delivering to students the necessary tools to go ahead and build something meaningful. There's still that next step(s) needed to be taken by the student to further the knowledge learned in the course. It's not that it wasn't possible; the amount of work required to put into it was not straightforward!

## Enter Fastai

I heard about Fastai and Jeremy Howard from my friends around version 1 of the course. I pushed it aside as one of the many courses suggested by people in the field due to their inherent allegiance to it having taken it. But over time, on Twitter, LinkedIn, and other sources, it had reached a point that I couldn't not take a look at the course. So I finally succumbed to the pressure and started last year's [course](https://course.fast.ai/).

In less than two weeks, I binged watch through the entire part 1! The course was nothing like I had taken  before! All the concepts explained intuitively in simple and easy manner and more importantly, everything taught was visualized through code and by building state-of-the-art models. Unfortunately, I couldn't put in the necessary focus and didn't follow through completely. But this time around I made sure to take a break in order to pursue the course this time around.

## ~~Fact: Deep learning is hard~~
## Fact: Deep learning is easy, if done right!

The main idea of the [course](https://www.fast.ai/) and the [library](https://dev.fast.ai/) is to democratize this powerful tool of 'Deep Learning', such that it can be easily harnessed by people across all domains such that one apply the principles easily in their domain.

The course challenges the normal way of learning by following a top-down approach to understanding deep learning. In comparison to every other DL course under the sun, this course definitely makes the field easy to approach and most importantly it makes the implementation of the models very very easy.

Everything taught in this year's course is again application-driven and closely follows the book written by the founders of fastai, Jeremy, and Sylvain. The only prerequisites needed to start with the course are high school math and intermediate coding skills in python, which, to be honest, can be picked up along the way(I'll be sure to put up references for all in the end). This doesn't mean that the course if geared for beginners, on the contrary veterans and beginners in the field, will have a lot discover in the course as the slowly peel through the nuances of the library, the ingenious implementations of various well-known libraries by incorporating clever tricks and insights learned through experimentation!

The lectures taught by Jeremy, the book as a manual to wade through the 'frightening' depths of deep learning, a fantastic community of like-minded and extremely helpful peers, is a complete package and the perfect recipe to learn. I couldn't be more glad to be taking part in such an enriching learning experience, especially during these trying times, and despite it being virtual, I don't believe it has lost a beat.

## My blog post series

There's definitely a self-centered motivation to write these blog posts. Following the advice by Rachel Thomas(co-founder of fast.ai) in her [blog post](https://medium.com/@racheltho/why-you-yes-you-should-blog-7d2544ac1045), she encourages anyone on a learning path to put out blog posts in-order to maximize your learning.

But aside the learning advantages, I would like to do my best in helping guide people entering this field on how best to navigate the myriad resources in the field and hopefully impart some of the knowledge learned along my journey until now.

Being quarantined, I find this time to be the best opportunity to start my blog by delving into depths of this fantastic deep-learning library!

The course is currently private but will made public and free for all like all courses by fast.ai. Until then and hopefully even then, I hope I can help wade students through the mazes of Deep Learning, Fast.ai style! So let's get into it!

In my upcoming blog [post](https://harish3110.github.io/through-tinted-lenses/fastai/classification/2020/03/29/Getting-started-with-Fastai-V2.html), i'll provide an introduction to the fastai v2 library and build an image classifier on a well-known dataset.
